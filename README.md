# Web3 Frontend QA Checklist

This repo contains reproducible checklists and templates to validate Web3 frontends, focusing on:

- Route integrity and fallback handling  
- Asset loading and visual consistency  
- Network logic and RPC error resilience

## Why this matters

In Web3, a broken route or RPC call can cost users real funds. This repo helps teams prevent critical UX failures through proactive QA.

## Use cases

- Pre-launch QA for DApps and wallets  
- Freelance delivery validation  
- Educational onboarding for junior devs

## Structure

- `checklists/`: Modular QA guides by category  
- `examples/`: Real-world breakdowns (e.g. Solana wallet UI)  
- `templates/`: QA report formats for clients or teams
